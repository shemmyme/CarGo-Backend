# Psychophysics and Cognition (`psycog`)

This software is for measuring psychophysical and cognitive abilities in humans. I use it
for my own research, but it is open source and freely available for anyone to use.

## Installation

### Python Package

`psycog` is a Python package. You can install it using `pip`:

```bash

pip install psycog

```

Due to the large number of dependencies, it is strongly recommended that you install 
`psycog` in a fresh [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

### Standalone Executable

I intend to make `psycog` available as a standalone executable in the future. This will
allow you to run experiments without having to install Python or any dependencies, though
the executable will be quite large (~1GB). This is not yet available.

## Usage

### Command Line

`psycog` is GUI-based. To run it, simply type `psycog` into the command line. This will
open the main menu, from which you can select the experiments you wish to run.

### Python

You can also run the GUI from inside a Python REPL or script, though I'm not sure why you
would want to do this.

```python

from psycog import run

run()

```
